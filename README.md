# What-is-Data-Science-Project 
## Description
What-is-Data-Science-Project is my project for the Information Retrieval Course at PNU, which covers key concepts such as:
- Preprocess the Data:
    - Converting to lowercase
    - Removing punctuation
    - Removing stop words
    - Lemmatization/Stemming
- Calculating TF-IDF
- Ranking Using Cosine Similarity depends on the highest score

I'm sharing this project to support anyone interested in Information Retrieval (IR) and to provide a practical example of real Python code in action. Enjoy exploring❤️
